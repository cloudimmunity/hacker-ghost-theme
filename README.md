# Hacker Ghost Theme

A simple theme for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/) **v0.5.x**. See it action on this blog [Devs â™¥ Security](http://devs.cloudimmunity.com).

Based on the Innocent theme.

Have fun hacking it!

# Overview

* No time (because your posts are timeless ;-))
* No comments (because nobody really uses them anymore)
* Share posts on Reddit, Hacker News, and Twitter.
* Highlight.js code highlighting (inherited from Innocent)
* Extra visualization libraries (dc.js, crossfilter.js, and d3.js)
* Helpers to make it easier to include JavaScript code in your posts.
